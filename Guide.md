# Guide

## Setting up environment

Sample `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files are included in this repo along with a basic scaffolded
Rails application.

There is a `Makefile` included for your convenience that has sample commands for building
and managing your application via the command line.

Please make sure you can bring up your app with `make up` well before the start of the
test. You should be able to run the tests if the basic setup works.

```bash
$ make
$ make build
$ make dbcreate
$ make test
```

If you need to use generators with docker:

```bash
docker-compose run app bundle exec rails scaffold users
```

Or, alternatively, you can "ssh" into the container (to exit, type `exit` or `ctrl + d`)

```bash
$ make bash
$ bundle exec rails g scaffold users
```

**NOTE** since the generator runs inside of Docker (and this container runs as
the `root` user), you will need to change the permissions of the generated
files. The following command is added as a convenience and should be run after
generated files are created to avoid "write permission" failures.

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER .
```

OR

```bash
make chown
```

## Requirements

You have been given the basic data models: `Doctor`, `Patient`, and `Appointment`. For the
purpose of this exercise, you can assume that the `Patient` will only have one `Doctor`.

### Requirement 1: seed the database

Seed the database using `db/migrate/seeds.rb`

- There should be 10 Doctors with unique names
- Each doctor should have 10 patients with unique names
- Each patient should have 10 appointments (5 in the past, 5 in the future)

### Requirement 2: api/appointments endpoint

Return all appointments.

The spec for the endpoint requires the following structure:

```
[
  {
    id: <int>,
    patient: { name: <string> },
    doctor : { name: <string>, id: <int> },
    created_at: <iso8601>,
    start_time: <iso8601>,
    duration_in_minutes: <int>
  }, ...
]
```

### Requirement 3: allow the api/appointments endpoint to return filtered records

The following url params should filter the results:

- `?past=1` returns only appointments in the past
- `?past=0` returns only appointments in the future
- `?length=5&page=1` returns paginated appointments, starting at `page`; use page size of `length`

### Requirement 4: create a new endpoint api/doctors

Create a new endpoint that returns all doctors that do not have an appointment.

### Requirement 5: create new appointment POST to api/appointments

```
{
  patient: { name: <string> },
  doctor: { id: <int> },
  start_time: <iso8604>,
  duration_in_minutes: <int>
}
```

## Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating the program, the following are among the factors considered:

- Does it run?
- Does it produce the correct output?
- How did _you_ gain confidence your submission is correct?
- Were appropriate algorithms and data structures chosen?
- Was it well written? Are the source code and algorithms implemented cleanly?
  Would we enjoy your code living along side our own?
- Is it slow? For small to medium sized inputs, the processing delay should
  probably not be noticeable.
